  <p><h1><strong>Fun Concepts I Learned on Coding!!!</strong></h1></p>

<p></p><b>How the Web Works</b></p>
<li><b>Browser</b> - a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web.</li>
<li><b>Intertnet</b> - the world's largest computer network</li>
<li><b>http</b> - the main protocal of the web</li>
<li><b>Servers</b> - the computers that host the files that make up the web</li>
<br>
The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like <a href=https://www.google.com">google</a>, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request to a server.</em> The server finds the appropriate <b>HTML</b> document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
<b><p>HTML</p></b>
<b>HTML</b> stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <b>HTML</b> documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes <b>"what you see"</b> and <em>markup</em> which describes <b>"how it looks."</b>

<b><p>Tags and Elements</p></b>
<b>HTML</b> documents are made of <b>HTML</b> elements. When writing <b>HTML</b>, we tell browsers the type of each <b>element</b> by using <b>HTML</b> tags. This video explains the distinction well.

<b><p>Why Computers are Stupid</p></b>
Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

<b><p>Inline vs Block Elements</b></p>
<p><b>HTML</b> elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b></a>. <b>Block</b> elements form an <em>"invisible box"</em></a> around the content inside of them. <b>Inline</b> takes up only as much width as it needs, and does not force new lines</p>
